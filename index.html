  <h1>Eunice ❤️</h1>

  <p>
    Not with grand declarations, but with the soft scratch of a pencil, a shared textbook,
    and a question about a Mechanics problem I was too proud to admit I couldn’t solve alone.
    You, Eunice, with your calm strength, didn’t just give me the answer. You gave me your patience.
    You drew the equation, you explained the logic, and when understanding finally dawned on me,
    your laugh didn’t feel like celebration — it felt like a gift.
  </p>

  <p>
    Slowly, the world of formulas began to dissolve. Between sessions on Pure Maths and Mechanics,
    we built a new language. One made of dreams whispered across a desk, of fears confessed under
    the fluorescent lights, and of a trust built not in grand moments, but in the quiet, consistent
    choice to show up, to listen, to see each other.
  </p>

  <p>
    What began as academic support became the foundation of my life.
    You became my safest place, my most honest conversation, my home.
  </p>

  <p>
    And then, I asked you out. The first date, at the cinema watching <em>Bagman</em>,
    is etched in my memory not for the film, but for the sacred quiet between us.
    The nervousness was tangible, but it was outshone by the way you looked in the dim light,
    and the faint, heavenly scent of your perfume that made my world tilt on its axis.
  </p>

  <p>
    You were no longer just my study partner; you were a vision,
    and my heart finally understood what my soul had known for years.
  </p>

  <p>
    The second date — the park picnic — was where our story truly began to breathe.
    Surrounded by grass and sunlight, the last of our formal walls crumbled.
    Our first kiss was shy and sweet, a promise whispered without words.
  </p>

  <p>
    And when that mischievous dog sprinted off with our fried chicken,
    we didn’t get upset — we fell into a fit of pure, unburdened laughter.
    We let go of everything that day.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Polaroid pictures we took captured more than our smiles;
    they captured the moment I saw our future, bright and boundless, in your eyes.
    We’ve been to the cinema many times since, but the greatest story we’re watching unfold
    isn’t on any screen.
  </p>

  <p>
    It’s the one we’re writing together, frame by beautiful frame.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now, a year (and a few months) since you said “yes” to being my girlfriend,
    my gratitude defies words. It lives in the steady rhythm of our shared life.
  </p>

  <p>
    It’s in the profound peace of your presence, the warmth of your hand in mine,
    and the unparalleled joy of waking up every single day to a simple text:
    “Good morning, babe ☺️.”
  </p>

  <p>
    You are my greatest discovery, my most cherished equation —
    where everything balances perfectly to form a love I never dared dream of.
  </p>
